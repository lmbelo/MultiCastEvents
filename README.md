# Natural Multicast Events

Natural Multicast Events have been done to be... natural!

It is still Beta, but you can full-feel its power.

It is simple, but powerfull:

1) Naturally add listeners to any event, even already signed events;
2) Any event property can be extended naturaly to multicast;
3) Anonymous listeners are supported;
4) The multicast container is managed by the library itself;
